## Technology Used

Python Libraries Capable of Voice Recognition and Translation. Image Fetching API is used to fetch random as well as correct Images.

## Inspiration

'Anki' is an app/program used for learning vocabulary for different languages, but it only
uses the text-based approach to teach it's learners.

But if we use our visual memory to learn vocabulary, the results could be achieved quickly
as our memory relies more on images rather than texts.

## Functioning

When the function is called initally a locally defined list of dictionary is imported, the number visible i.e. 25487 is the number of elements loaded. This can be edited depending upon the use. Look into the list.py file.

Voice Recognition and Translation is Done, this results in fetching images using API.

3 Images are downloaded - 1 Correct + 2 Incorrect

The backend program can be used for a Game like 'Anki' Program. Features that can be added could include a timer and scoreboard with some soothing graphics.
